# Unit Testing In Python

This is a repository for learning unit testing in Python. It contains the following files:

* `README.md`: This file describes the project.
* `test_module.py`: This file contains unit tests for the `module.py` file.
* `module.py`: This file contains the code that is being tested.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine. Then, open the `test_module.py` file in a text editor. You can run the unit tests by typing the following command in the terminal:

```
python -m unittest test_module
```

## Unit Testing

Unit testing is a software testing method that is used to test individual units of code. Unit tests are typically written by developers as they are writing their code. This helps to ensure that the code is working as expected and that it is free of bugs.

The `test_module.py` file in this repository contains unit tests for the `module.py` file. The unit tests are written using the [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) module.

Each unit test in the `test_module.py` file tests a specific function in the `module.py` file. For example, the following unit test tests the `add()` function:

```python
def test_add():
    """Test the add() function."""

    assert add(1, 2) == 3
```

The `assert` statement in the unit test checks that the return value of the `add()` function is equal to 3. If the return value of the `add()` function is not equal to 3, the unit test will fail.

## Conclusion

Unit testing is an important part of software development. It helps to ensure that the code is working as expected and that it is free of bugs. By writing unit tests, developers can catch bugs early in the development process, which can save time and money.
